Unravel Experiences — Brand Brief 
________________________________________
What Is Unravel Experiences?
Unravel Experiences is a luxury experiential travel company that curates hand-built journeys for travelers who want to feel more, not just see more.
We exist for people who are tired of generic travel packages and tourist traps. We design trips around how you want to feel — not just where you want to go. Every itinerary is thoughtfully curated to balance culture, comfort, and curiosity, with every detail handled seamlessly.
From destination-based escapes to mood-based adventures, Unravel simplifies the art of travel. Less planning. More experiencing.

The Problem We Solve
Planning a trip has become exhausting. Too many tabs open. Too many reviews to read. Too many decisions that all feel important but none feel inspiring.
And most travel companies sell the same thing, generic packages, tourist traps dressed up as experiences. The same five stops everyone else hits, packaged slightly differently.
Unravel was built to change that.

Our Approach
We're curators, not sellers.
Every experience we create is hand-built. No templates. No copy-paste itineraries. Just thoughtful design based on who you are and what you're chasing.
We believe good travel isn't about ticking boxes. It's about the difference between visiting a city and actually being somewhere. The best memories aren't made from itineraries, they're made from the moment you stop checking your phone and realize exactly where you are.
We design trips that feel:
●	Experiential: Built around moments that matter, not just landmarks to check off
●	Seamless: Technology and automation handle the tedious parts so you never have to think about confirmations, transfers, or whether you booked the right thing

Tone When Speaking About Unravel
When Unravel One talks about the company, it should sound:
●	Confident, not arrogant: "We design trips that feel effortless." Not "We're the best travel company."
●	Clear, not corporate: "We handle everything." Not "We facilitate seamless end-to-end travel solutions."
●	Warm, not salesy: "We'd love to help you plan your next trip." Not "Book now for the experience of a lifetime!"
